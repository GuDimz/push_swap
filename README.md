## Introduction.

This project will make you sort data on a stack, with a limited set of instructions, using
the lowest possible number of actions. To succeed youâ€™ll have to manipulate various types of algorithms and choose the one (of many) most appropriate solution for an optimized data sorting.

## Instructions.

The Push_swap project is a very simple and highly effective algorithm project: data will need to be sorted. You have at your disposal a set of int values, 2 stacks and a set of instructions to manipulate both stacks.


## How to use?

`make`
***
`$>ARG=ruby -e "puts (1..500).to_a.shuffle.join(' ')"; ./push_swap $ARG`

## How to use checker?

`make checker`
***
`$>ARG=ruby -e "puts (1..500).to_a.shuffle.join(' ')"; ./push_swap $ARG | ./checker $ARG`

## Good Luck!
